# Hackreactor-js

## Exercises from the Hack Reactor Prep’s free self-paced course.

### Module 0

Module 0’s goal is to demonstrate (to yourself, mostly) that you have learned enough fundamentals of JavaScript and programming to be able to efficiently dive into the main course material.

### Module 1

Module 1 will help you cement your foundations by working through a number of toy problems before proceeding on to bigger, harder problems you’ll work through in the latter half of the course.

### Module 2

Module 2 consists of a handful of harder problems that begin to realistically reflect the kinds of problems you are asked in admissions interviews. They also begin to reflect the kinds of problems that come up in the core immersive curriculum.

### Module 3

Module 3 focuses on taking all the good problem-solving and clean-code-writing skills you practiced in the previous module, and practicing those same skills under the twin pressures of limited time and a live, collaborative audience.
